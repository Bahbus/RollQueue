# Repository-wide Guidelines

- Do not add binary files (including raster images) to this repository. All assets must be committed as text-based formats.
- When an image is required, provide it as inline SVG code checked into the repository instead of binary formats such as PNG, JPG, or GIF.
- Ensure any new directories you add also respect these rules; add nested `AGENTS.md` files if additional context or stricter requirements are needed.
